# Understanding Cheng and Church Bi-clustering Algorithm using MTBA library

## What is Discussed In this Project:
1) Cheng and Church Biclustering Algorithm
2) Input Parameters and their impact on results
3) Resluts of Cheng and Church Biclustering on Abalone Dataset


## How to run MATLAB Files:

Download and Import MTBA Library to MATLAB from the link below:   
[MATLAB Toolbox for Biclustering Analysis](http://www.iitk.ac.in/idea/mtba/)

Download and Import files from this repository.

To recreate results for synthetic dataset run file, cc_subSpaceCData.m   
To recreate results for Abalone dataset run file, CC_biclust_abalone.m
